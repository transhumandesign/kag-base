## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a user engages in unacceptable behavior, the moderators and administrators may take any action
they deem appropriate, up to and including permanent expulsion from the community without warning
for extreme offences or for those with a history of repeated abuse.

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify
a community administrator as soon as possible.

## 7. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should
notify us in the discord server with a concise description of your grievance.

Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing policies.

## 8. Scope

We expect all community participants to abide by this Code of Conduct for all behaviour around the
repository – as well as in all group and one-on-one communications related to development.

This includes the `#development` channel on the official discord.

Other media (discord, forums) are governed by their own rules and codes of conduct. If and where
the codes disagree, the most relevant code to each media should take precedence.
