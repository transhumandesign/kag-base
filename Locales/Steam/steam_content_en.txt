# Steam Strings - For Translation Purposes

These strings are provided to allow localisation of the steam content.

They are not read directly by the game.

# Guidelines:

You do not need to translate the headings "# Description:" etc - these are just
to separate the strings into logical sections for you.

BBCode images should be left "as is".

BBCode tags should probably  be "semantically" preserved between descriptions.
They don't appear to be used on the store pages in most contexts though.

Please issue a pull request for this file with the correct locale suffix if you
contribute to localisation. Copy this file as a starting point if a copy for
your locale does not already exist.
