	== KING ARTHUR'S GOLD SERVER SETUP INFO ==

# Basic Overview:

If you want to host your own server just run the following
script from your KAG directory:

- dedicatedserver.bat on Windows
- dedicatedserver.sh on Linux

## On Windows:

- Double click dedicatedserver.bat and a launcher should start which looks like your normal launcher,
but you got a cmd on the back.

- Start game, press Play and the server starts and gets all the required files..

- Use connect in the multiplayer tab
and you use your LOCAL IP to connect which is 127.0.0.1 (from your computer)

- The default port on which the server works is 50301.
Be sure to forward this port on your firewall and router if need be.

--(Optional,if you cannot portforward)
Get logmein hamachi.
Create a local network.
Give the login and pass to your friends(They need hamachi too)
connect by using your hamachi ipv4 which you can do by right clicking on your long ip or on the server.

- Make your friends connect to your game via the master server 
(Edit dedicatedserver.cfg file to change the name)

## On Linux:

- Set executable permissions:

	$ chmod +x KAG
	$ chmod +x dedicatedserver.sh

- If the executable updates, you might need to rename the
updated file and set executable permissions again. Like this:

	$ mv KAG.tmp KAG
	$ chmod +x KAG

- The default port on which the server works is 50301.
Be sure to forward this port on your firewall and router if need be.

# More Detail:

The community has a hosting guide here: https://wiki.kag2d.com/wiki/Server

# Configuring your server:

CONFIG FILE: `autoconfig.cfg` (in the game folder)

If you mess something up you can regenerate this file by renaming it
(so you have a backup) and running KAG fresh, it will be generated upon
closing the game.

Parameter effects are described alongside each parameter in the file.

Some parameters worth considering:

- General Server: `sv_port`, `sv_name`, `sv_info`, `sv_password`, `sv_rconpassword`
- Map Generation: `m_width`, `m_height`, `m_seed`
- Game Config: `sv_maxplayers`, `sv_gamemode`, `sv_mapcycle`

AUTOSTART SCRIPT: `Base/Scripts/server_autostart.as`

This allows you to run custom code when starting up your server.

# Remote Administration

Make sure you set the rcon password in your config - the parameter is sv_rconpassword.

Open the client, join your server and open the console (HOME key).

Type `\rcon \login <password>`. If you login succesfully, you can now use the console
as if you are on the machine, using the prefix `\rcon`. Example: `\rcon \loadmap autosave`.

# Basic console commands:

	\list - list all commands and variables
	\rcon \login [password]       - authenticate with rcon
	\restartmap                   - restarts the current map
	\loadmap [name]               - loads a new map
	\savemap [name]               - saves the current state of the map to the maps folder
	\msg [text]                   - sends a message to everyone on the server (appears in the chat window)
	\players                      - lists the players
	\swapid [player id]           - swaps a player's team
	\kick [playername] [minutes]  - kick a player out of the game
	\unban [name]                 - unban a player
	\ban [name] [minutes]         - ban a player
	\sv_test [1/0]                - enables or disables "testing mode" which allows the use of some commands through the chat system ingame

# Command line:

You may start server with specific ip,port,slots eg.

	./KAG ip 123.124.125.126 port 50213 slots 32 nolauncher

These options override various config set options, which allows server hosting companies greater control over their hosted servers.

These options cannot be modified at runtime, but are normally most easily set in the config - the command line just takes precedence.
